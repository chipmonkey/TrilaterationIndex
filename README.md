Chip Lynch's Master's Thesis

This is a work in progress, unless I forgot to update this, but for now...

## License Note
At the moment this software is closed source
I intend to keep it this way until I can get it to an initial v1.0 state
and to maintain lineage while working on my Master's degree.

Whenever that is, I do intend to release this under some open source
license - which one TBD.  If for some reason this gets into your hands
and you feel it may be useful to you, feel free to reach out and we
can see if we can work something out in the meantime.
