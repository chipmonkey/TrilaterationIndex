# Using Trilateration Distances as Geospatial Coordinates, Indexes, and Geohashes

### Abstract
We present an alternative method for pre-processing and storing geospatial point data to improve query performance for some distance related queries such as "find all points in a set $P$ within distance $d$ of query point $q$".  This pre-processing can be used to improve existing algorithms for Nearest-Neighbor (NN) searches, and lend themselves to new algorithms which offer some performance improvements and tradeoffs vs. existing algorithms.  

Our construction includes storing the distances from fixed points (typically three, as in trilateration) as an alternative to Latitude and Longitude.  This effectively creates a coordinate system where the coordinates are the trilateration distances.  We explore this alternative coordinate system and the theoretical, technical, and practical implications of using it.  Trilateration is a common concept, widely used in GPS and closely related to Triangulation used in cartography, surveying, and orienteering, although algorithmic use of these concepts for NN-style problems are scarce.

Initial results are promising for some use cases.  Nearest-neighbor logic is both simplified (compared to R/kd/ball-Tree style indexing) and performant.  Trilateration (or, more generally, "n-point lateration") is applicable to 2D, 3D, and higher dimension systems with minimal adaptation.  We see a roughly 10x performance improvement in SQL queries using this preparation

Further, we discuss the problem of "Network Adequacy" common to medical and communications businesses, to analyze questions such as "are at least 90% of patients living within 50 miles of a covered emergency room".  This is in fact the class of question that led to the creation of our pre-processing and algorithms, and is a generalization of a class of Nearest-Neighbor problems.

We construct implementations of the Trilateration Index in both python, for general algorithimc use, and in SQL for use in relational databases, showing flexibility that is not as readuly available with the more complicated space partitioning algorithms.

While we focus primarily on geospatial data, otential applications to this approach extend to any distance-measured n-dimensional metric space, and we touch on those (briefly, here, to constrain our scope).  For example, we consider applying the technique to Levenshtein distance, MIST datasets via cosine-similarity, and even facial recognition or taxicab systems where distances do not follow the triangle inequality.
