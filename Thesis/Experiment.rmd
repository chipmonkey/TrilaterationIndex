# Experimentation

## Experimental Setup

We plan several experiments for Network Adequacy in SQL databases, and Nearest Neighbor applications using Python.

### Experiment 1: Python Nearest Neighbors with ANN

We adapt the popular Python package scikit-learn to execute our Trilateration Index and perform nearest-neighbor search.
We adapt the ann-benchmarks software, which is designed explicitly for comparing performance of nearest neighbor algorithms[@Amueller2020], to record results.
