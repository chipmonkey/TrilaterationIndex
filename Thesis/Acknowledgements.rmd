Thanks to my Wifey - Mary Ann Lynch - for putting up with and supporting the hours of late nights in front of my laptop.  Thanks also to my family and friends who I'm sure I ignored more than I should while I worked on this, and to the teams at Passport Health Plan and SpaceX for having real-world problems to solve that led to an interesting thesis topic.  And of course I appreciate the help and guidance of all the teachers, professors, and mentors I've had.  But mostly still thanks to my Wifey.
