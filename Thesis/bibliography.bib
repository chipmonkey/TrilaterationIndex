   abstract = {Since the launch of the health insurance marketplaces under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), many health insurers have competed for customers by offering plans with narrow provider networks at lower costs than plans with broader networks. All marketplace health plans are required to provide their enrollees with access to covered services " without unreasonable delay, " but the increased reliance on narrow provider networks has raised concerns over whether consumers have timely access to needed health care. Previous studies have analyzed the different network adequacy standards states use to regulate provider networks; this study addresses the systems state regulators use to analyze, evaluate, and monitor compliance with network adequacy standards. These systems likely will become increasingly important. In February 2017, the Trump administration proposed to loosen federal network adequacy standards in the federal marketplace and delegate more responsibility to state regulators for network adequacy review. Some states may respond by adapting their network adequacy standards and systems to address the evolving nongroup market. Regardless of what system emerges from the initiative to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, insurers are expected to continue to rely on narrow provider networks to compete for customers in the nongroup market. 1 With less federal regulation of the nongroup market, state regulation of network adequacy will become increasingly significant and more states may consider whether to increase their regulation and oversight of provider networks. As states consider how to ensure that consumers get timely access to necessary care through increasingly narrow provider networks, this study offers some cross-cutting observations from four states with experience overseeing health plan compliance with network adequacy standards: California, Colorado, Illinois, and Nevada. Collectively the four study states have many years of experience analyzing, monitoring, and enforcing network adequacy standards. Although their standards and systems for reviewing compliance with those standards differ, some common themes may provide lessons for policymakers and regulators nationwide: • Quantitative standards and related metrics help regulators evaluate network adequacy, but regulators need flexibility in applying those standards. • A combination of standardized forms and narrative submissions help regulators analyze network adequacy. • States vary in the extent to which regulators require insurers to change or supplement proposed networks. • States vary in their transparency about insurer network submissions and regulators' review of those submissions. • Challenges remain in assessing and monitoring network adequacy. These include » ensuring the accuracy of provider directories, With support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF), the Urban Institute is undertaking a comprehensive monitoring and tracking project to examine the implementation and effects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA). The project began in May 2011 and will take place over several years. The Urban Institute will document changes to the implementation of national health reform to help states, researchers and policymakers learn from the process as it unfolds. Reports that have been prepared as part of this ongoing project can be found at www.rwjf.org and www.healthpolicycenter.org. ACA Implementation—Monitoring and Tracking 3 » addressing the needs of rural communities, » evaluating network adequacy when multiple plans count the same providers to meet state quantitative standards, and » strengthening the systems for gathering and using consumer complaints and grievances to monitor and identify current network adequacy problems. As the nongroup market evolves, state standards and state regulators will become increasingly important in ensuring that health plans' provider networks meet the health care needs of their enrollees.},

The goal is obtaining the maximum of network adequacy with lowest expansion cost for a specific investment. Finally, the proposed idea is applied to the Garvers 6-bus network. The results show that considering the network adequacy for solution of STNEP problem is caused that among of expansion plans for a determined investment, configuration which has relatively lower expansion cost and higher adequacy is proposed by GA based method. Finally, with respect to the curve of adequacy versus expansion cost it can be said that more optimal configurations for expansion of network are obtained with lower investment costs.},

@article{Ahmadi2019,
   abstract = {With the evolution of smart grids, penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) in the distribution networks has become ever-increasing problem. To improve network reliability, the complexity of the two important aspects of adequacy and security must be well assessed. There is a trade-off between adequacy of DERs, and the distribution network security, i.e. improving the adequacy can reduce the security. In this study, enhancement of the distribution network adequacy and security is proposed. In this regard, capacity of simultaneous reconfiguration and DERs sizing are utilised to improve the adequacy and security of an active distribution network. In the reconfiguration process, graph theory concept is adopted to implement a fast reconfiguration method. Since DERs are active, a combined bus and line security index is used to overcome security concerns of their existence. The IEEE 33-bus distribution network as a widely used standard test system in reconfiguration studies, and a practical 83-bus distribution network of Taiwan Power Company (TPC) which is a part of a real distribution network, are used to test the performance of the proposed method. The simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed framework.},

   abstract = {Similarity search finds application in database systems handling complex data such as images or videos, which are typically represented by high-dimensional features and require specific indexing structures. This paper tackles the problem of better utilizing GPUs for this task. While GPUs excel at data parallel tasks such as distance computation, prior approaches in this domain are bottlenecked by algorithms that expose less parallelism, such as k-min selection, or make poor use of the memory hierarchy. We propose a novel design for k-selection. We apply it in different similarity search scenarios, by optimizing brute-force, approximate and compressed-domain search based on product quantization. In all these setups, we outperform the state of the art by large margins. Our implementation operates at up to 55% of theoretical peak performance, enabling a nearest neighbor implementation that is 8.5x faster than prior GPU state of the art. It enables the construction of a high accuracy k-NN graph on 95 million images from the YFCC100M dataset in 35 minutes, and of a graph connecting 1 billion vectors in less than 12 hours on 4 Maxwell Titan X GPUs. We have open-sourced our approach for the sake of comparison and reproducibility.},
