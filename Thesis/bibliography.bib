   abstract = {Since the launch of the health insurance marketplaces under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), many health insurers have competed for customers by offering plans with narrow provider networks at lower costs than plans with broader networks. All marketplace health plans are required to provide their enrollees with access to covered services " without unreasonable delay, " but the increased reliance on narrow provider networks has raised concerns over whether consumers have timely access to needed health care. Previous studies have analyzed the different network adequacy standards states use to regulate provider networks; this study addresses the systems state regulators use to analyze, evaluate, and monitor compliance with network adequacy standards. These systems likely will become increasingly important. In February 2017, the Trump administration proposed to loosen federal network adequacy standards in the federal marketplace and delegate more responsibility to state regulators for network adequacy review. Some states may respond by adapting their network adequacy standards and systems to address the evolving nongroup market. Regardless of what system emerges from the initiative to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, insurers are expected to continue to rely on narrow provider networks to compete for customers in the nongroup market. 1 With less federal regulation of the nongroup market, state regulation of network adequacy will become increasingly significant and more states may consider whether to increase their regulation and oversight of provider networks. As states consider how to ensure that consumers get timely access to necessary care through increasingly narrow provider networks, this study offers some cross-cutting observations from four states with experience overseeing health plan compliance with network adequacy standards: California, Colorado, Illinois, and Nevada. Collectively the four study states have many years of experience analyzing, monitoring, and enforcing network adequacy standards. Although their standards and systems for reviewing compliance with those standards differ, some common themes may provide lessons for policymakers and regulators nationwide: • Quantitative standards and related metrics help regulators evaluate network adequacy, but regulators need flexibility in applying those standards. • A combination of standardized forms and narrative submissions help regulators analyze network adequacy. • States vary in the extent to which regulators require insurers to change or supplement proposed networks. • States vary in their transparency about insurer network submissions and regulators' review of those submissions. • Challenges remain in assessing and monitoring network adequacy. These include » ensuring the accuracy of provider directories, With support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF), the Urban Institute is undertaking a comprehensive monitoring and tracking project to examine the implementation and effects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA). The project began in May 2011 and will take place over several years. The Urban Institute will document changes to the implementation of national health reform to help states, researchers and policymakers learn from the process as it unfolds. Reports that have been prepared as part of this ongoing project can be found at www.rwjf.org and www.healthpolicycenter.org. ACA Implementation—Monitoring and Tracking 3 » addressing the needs of rural communities, » evaluating network adequacy when multiple plans count the same providers to meet state quantitative standards, and » strengthening the systems for gathering and using consumer complaints and grievances to monitor and identify current network adequacy problems. As the nongroup market evolves, state standards and state regulators will become increasingly important in ensuring that health plans' provider networks meet the health care needs of their enrollees.},

   abstract = {With the evolution of smart grids, penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) in the distribution networks has become ever-increasing problem. To improve network reliability, the complexity of the two important aspects of adequacy and security must be well assessed. There is a trade-off between adequacy of DERs, and the distribution network security, i.e. improving the adequacy can reduce the security. In this study, enhancement of the distribution network adequacy and security is proposed. In this regard, capacity of simultaneous reconfiguration and DERs sizing are utilised to improve the adequacy and security of an active distribution network. In the reconfiguration process, graph theory concept is adopted to implement a fast reconfiguration method. Since DERs are active, a combined bus and line security index is used to overcome security concerns of their existence. The IEEE 33-bus distribution network as a widely used standard test system in reconfiguration studies, and a practical 83-bus distribution network of Taiwan Power Company (TPC) which is a part of a real distribution network, are used to test the performance of the proposed method. The simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed framework.},

   abstract = {Similarity search finds application in database systems handling complex data such as images or videos, which are typically represented by high-dimensional features and require specific indexing structures. This paper tackles the problem of better utilizing GPUs for this task. While GPUs excel at data parallel tasks such as distance computation, prior approaches in this domain are bottlenecked by algorithms that expose less parallelism, such as k-min selection, or make poor use of the memory hierarchy. We propose a novel design for k-selection. We apply it in different similarity search scenarios, by optimizing brute-force, approximate and compressed-domain search based on product quantization. In all these setups, we outperform the state of the art by large margins. Our implementation operates at up to 55% of theoretical peak performance, enabling a nearest neighbor implementation that is 8.5x faster than prior GPU state of the art. It enables the construction of a high accuracy k-NN graph on 95 million images from the YFCC100M dataset in 35 minutes, and of a graph connecting 1 billion vectors in less than 12 hours on 4 Maxwell Titan X GPUs. We have open-sourced our approach for the sake of comparison and reproducibility.},

   abstract = {This paper describes ANN-Benchmarks, a tool for evaluating the performance of in-memory approximate nearest neighbor algorithms. It provides a standard interface for measuring the performance and quality achieved by nearest neighbor algorithms on different standard data sets. It supports several different ways of integrating k-NN algorithms, and its configuration system automatically tests a range of parameter settings for each algorithm. Algorithms are compared with respect to many different (approximate) quality measures, and adding more is easy and fast; the included plotting front-ends can visualize these as images, LaTeX plots, and websites with interactive plots. ANN-Benchmarks aims to provide a constantly updated overview of the current state of the art of k-NN algorithms. In the short term, this overview allows users to choose the correct k-NN algorithm and parameters for their similarity search task; in the longer term, algorithm designers will be able to use this overview to test and refine automatic parameter tuning. The paper gives an overview of the system, evaluates the results of the benchmark, and points out directions for future work. Interestingly, very different approaches to k-NN search yield comparable quality-performance trade-offs. The system is available at http://ann-benchmarks.com.}

   abstract = {This paper develops the multidimensional binary search tree (or k-d tree, where k is the dimensionality of the search space) as a data structure for storage of information to be retrieved by associative searches. The k-d tree is defined and examples are given. It is shown to be quite efficient in its storage requirements. A significant advantage of this structure is that a single data structure can handle many types of queries very efficiently. Various utility algorithms are developed; their proven average running times in an n record file are: insertion, O(log n); deletion of the root, O(n(k-1)/k); deletion of a random node, O(log n); and optimization (guarantees logarithmic performance of searches), O(n log n). Search algorithms are given for partial match queries with t keys specified [proven maximum running time of O(n(k-t)/k)] and for nearest neighbor queries [empirically observed average running time of O(log n).] These performances far surpass the best currently known algorithms for these tasks. An algorithm is presented to handle any general intersection query. The main focus of this paper is theoretical. It is felt, however, that k-d trees could be quite useful in many applications, and examples of potential uses are given. © 1975, ACM. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {This paper is about non-approximate acceleration of high-dimensional nonparametric operations such as k nearest neighbor classifiers. We attempt to exploit the fact that even if we want exact answers to nonparametric queries, we usually do not need to explicitly find the data points close to the query, but merely need to answer questions about the properties of that set of data points. This offers a small amount of computational leeway, and we investigate how much that leeway can be exploited. This is applicable to many algorithms in nonparametric statistics, memory-based learning and kernel-based learning. But for clarity, this paper concentrates on pure k-NN classification. We introduce new ball-tree algorithms that on real-world data sets give accelerations from 2-fold to 100-fold compared against highly optimized traditional ball-tree-based k-NN. These results include data sets with up to 106 dimensions and 105 records, and demonstrate non-trivial speed-ups while giving exact answers.},

   abstract = {It is shown that for cuckoo hashing with a stash as proposed by Kirsch et al. (Proc. 16th European Symposium on Algorithms (ESA), pp. 611-622, Springer, Berlin, 2008) families of very simple hash functions can be used, maintaining the favorable performance guarantees: with constant stash size s the probability of a rehash is O(1/n s+1), the lookup time and the deletion time are O(s) in the worst case, and the amortized expected insertion time is O(s) as well. Instead of the full randomness needed for the analysis of Kirsch et al. and of Kutzelnigg (Discrete Math. Theor. Comput. Sci., 12(3):81-102, 2010) (resp. Θ(logn)-wise independence for standard cuckoo hashing) the new approach even works with 2-wise independent hash families as building blocks. Both construction and analysis build upon the work of Dietzfelbinger and Woelfel (Proc. 35th ACM Symp. on Theory of Computing (STOC), pp. 629-638, 2003). The analysis, which can also be applied to the fully random case, utilizes a graph counting argument and is much simpler than previous proofs. The results can be generalized to situations where the stash size is non-constant. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},
