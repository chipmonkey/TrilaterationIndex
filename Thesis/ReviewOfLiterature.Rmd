## Review of Current Literature

In general, we split our current literature review into two major sections:  1. Geospatial considerations and 2. Nearest Neighbor Algorithms, and a third minor section for ancillary references outside those two areas:

### Geospatial References

#### Haversine
#### Vincenty's Formula
Vincenty's Formula is a common non-spherical numeric solution to Earth-shaped ellipsoidal distance calculations [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1109.4448.pdf] however it "fails to converge for nearly antipodal points"
#### Karney's Formula - https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.4448
Improvements upon Vincenty's Formula have already been implemented in Python (https://pypi.org/project/geographiclib/), which we use in our Python implementations.
